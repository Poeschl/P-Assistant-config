# Poeschl's Home Assistant Configuration üè†

This is the backbone of my personal smart home system.
Its running Home Assistant and this are all of my configs for it.

The files are here as a second backup for me and to track my changes.
Its under development from time to time and it will change continuously.

# Structure

The structure of the config and also this repository is based on [Frenck's HA config](https://github.com/frenck/home-assistant-config).
You might be a little confused first, but for me this structure seems more logic and cleaner.
